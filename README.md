# Untitled Game

> _Untga_ is a text-based browser MMORPG that borrows ideas from [incremental games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) and [MMORPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game).

The project is under open development and isn't playable just yet. Meanwhile you can read and comment on;

## Development

### Getting started

You'll need:

1. Node.js v23+.
2. Docker Compose.
3. Traefik v2+ connected to a network named `traefik`.

Copy `compose.override.yml.development-example` as `compose.override.yml` and `.env.example` as `.env` and run:

```shell
docker compose up --watch
```

We use [Docker Compose's watch mode](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/) to automatically copy into the container files that are changed in the host.

Launch https://untga.local.crz.li.

### IDE integration

The container will isolate the `node_modules` directory, therefore dependencies and generated code, such as Next.js' types and Prisma's client, won't be locally available unless you fix it:

```shell
npm ci
npx prisma generate
npx next build
```

## Deployment

You'll need:

1. Docker Compose.
2. Traefik v2+ connected to a network named `traefik`.

Copy `compose.override.yml.production-example` as `compose.override.yml`, edit it according to your needs, then run:

```shell
docker compose up --detach
```
